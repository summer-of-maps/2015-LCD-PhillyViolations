# 2015-LCD-PhillyViolations
All violations from the Licences and Inspections database in one place. Scraped on August 1, 2015.

This repo is a result of data analysis completed as part of the Summer of Maps Program. This work was completed in support of a pro bono project with the Legal Clinic for the Disabled.

Summer of Maps is a fellowship program organized and facilitated by Azavea. Azavea is a B Corporation that specializes in civic-minded GIS software development and spatial analysis. Summer of Maps offers stipends to student spatial analysts to perform data analysis and visualization for non-profit organizations. Every year we match up non-profit organizations that have spatial analysis needs with talented students to implement projects over a three-month period during the summer.

The 2015 Summer of Maps program is sponsored by Esri, Temple University Professional Science Masters in GIS and Betsy and Jesse Fink.
